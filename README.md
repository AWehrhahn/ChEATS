ChEATS
-------
Characterization of Exoplanet Atmospheres with Transit Spectroscopy

ChEATS uses the cross correlation technique to analyze high resolution transit spectra.
The stellar and telluric signal is removed using SYSREM.
The model transmission spectra of the planet are generated with petitRADTRANS.
